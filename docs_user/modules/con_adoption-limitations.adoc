= Adoption limitations

Before you proceed with the adoption, check which features are considered a Technology Preview or are unsupported.

.Technology Preview

The following features are considered a Technology Preview and have not been tested within the context of the {rhos_long_noacro} adoption:

* {bare_metal_first_ref}
* NFS Ganesha back end for {rhos_component_storage_file_first_ref}
* iSCSI, NFS, and FC-based drivers for {block_storage_first_ref}
* The following {compute_service_first_ref} features:
** Compute hosts with `/var/lib/nova/instances` on NFS
** Hugepages
** Emulator thread policies
** NUMA aware vswitches
** CPU pinning
** PCI passthrough by flavor
** {networking_first_ref} single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) ports
** SR-IOV trusted virtual functions
** RX and TX queue sizes
** vGPU
** Virtio multiqueue
** Emulated virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM)
** UEFI
** AMD SEV
** Direct download from Rados Block Device (RBD)
** File-backed memory
** `Provider.yaml`

.Unsupported features

The adoption process does not support the following features:

* {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) {rhos_prev_ver} multi-cell deployments
* instanceHA
* DCN
* Designate
* {loadbalancer_first_ref}
* BGP
* IPv6
* Adopting a FIPS environment
* The {key_manager} only supports the simple crypto plug-in
* The {block_storage} only supports RBD back-end adoption


//* When you adopt a {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} FIPS environment to {rhos_acro} {rhos_curr_ver}, your adopted cluster remains a FIPS cluster. There is no option to change the FIPS status during adoption. If your cluster is FIPS-enabled, you must deploy a FIPS {rhocp_long} cluster to adopt your {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} FIPS control plane. For more information about enabling FIPS in {OpenShiftShort}, see link:{defaultOCPURL}/installing/installation-overview#installing-fips[Support for FIPS cryptography] in the {OpenShiftShort} _Installing_ guide.
